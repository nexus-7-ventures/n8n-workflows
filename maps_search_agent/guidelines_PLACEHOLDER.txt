IMPORTANT: Replace this file with your actual guidelines.txt file!

This is a placeholder file to show you exactly where to put your June 2024 Maps Search Guidelines.

Steps:
1. Delete this file (guidelines_PLACEHOLDER.txt)
2. Add your actual guidelines.txt file here
3. Make sure it's named exactly: guidelines.txt
4. Run: python setup.py to verify everything is ready
5. Run: python main.py to start the agent

The guidelines.txt file should contain your complete June 2024 Maps Search Evaluation guidelines with:
- Relevance levels (Navigational, Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Not Relevant)
- User intent analysis rules
- Demotion criteria (Distance, Prominence, Data Accuracy)
- Viewport age handling
- Closure detection logic
- Rating thresholds and examples

Without the proper guidelines.txt file, the agent cannot function correctly.
